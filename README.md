“Across the Sands of Time” is a game that combines a 3D FPS game, with flexible team size of up to 5 players per team, and a 2D combat/adventure game with 15 different maps, from 5 different time periods with different opponents, that are interconnected. There will be a selection interface where the user can choose between either of the games. 5 characters will be presented with different stories that have led them into this time travel adventure in the first place and hence they will possess different collections of weapons and a special skill which, collectively, make up the time-travel-based story of the game. Each character has their own story of how they have found the “mystery time machine” that teleports them to the designated maps and puts them in challenges to complete before they can move to the next levels/upgrade their character to utilise in the FPS game. Players will also be able to view their scores and ranks on the leaderboard presented of all previous players.
