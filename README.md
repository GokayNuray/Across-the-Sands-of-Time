### What is this repository for?
This repository is originally created for our CS102 group project as the group 3C. It is a game design that combines the 3D FPS experience with a 2D 1v1 combat game through its heartwarming time-travel based story.

### What is this game about?
“Across the Sands of Time” is a game that combines a voxelated 3D FPS game and a 2D combat/adventure that are interconnected. 5 characters will be presented with different stories that have led them into this time travel adventure in the first place and hence they will possess different collections of weapons and a special skill which, collectively, make up the time-travel-based story of the game. Each character has their own story of how they have found the “mystery time machine” that teleports them to the designated maps and puts them in challenges to complete before they can move to the next levels/upgrade their character to utilise in the FPS game. Players will also be able to view their scores and ranks on the leaderboard presented of all previous players.
